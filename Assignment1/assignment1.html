    <h1>Very Fresh Noodle</h1>

    <p>The chef stands alone behind a pane of glass in a cramped corner stall in Chelsea Market. It is not yet noon, the hour of madness. With the back of one hand, he swiftly pats down a small loaf’s worth of dough. When it’s flat, he snaps it on the counter, each snap stretching it, making it looser and sheerer, until it shimmies like a Chinese dancer’s never-ending sleeve.</p>

    <p>“Biang biang” is both the sound of the snapping and the name of the noodles made at Very Fresh Noodles, opened last February by Peter Tondreau and Victor Huang. The noodles’ origins go back to Shaanxi Province in northwestern China. Many New Yorkers know them from Xi’an Famous Foods, a growing chain that got its start in a stall in a basement food court in Flushing, Queens, and now has outposts across Manhattan.</p>

      <span class="caption1">Two straps of dough are stretched for each dish, drawn out to the wingspan of their maker, then torn lengthwise down the middle, the ragged edges all the better for catching drops of chile oil.</span>

      <p>The noodles may be familiar, but it’s still a thrill to stumble on a chef pulling them in the old style, like some ancient tailor unfurling bolts of cloth, among sleek kiosks selling artisanal mini-doughnuts and blueberry-cayenne smoothies.</p>

      <p>Two straps of dough are stretched for each dish, drawn out to the wingspan of their maker, then torn lengthwise down the middle, the ragged edges all the better for catching drops of chile oil. They’re too long to fish out of the soup whole; you must pray a little, bowing your head to eat.</p>

  <p>Made with high-protein flour for pliability, the noodles are at once elastic and dense, just short of al dente, demanding more of the teeth. In Mandarin, this quality is called jiao jing, sometimes translated from Mandarin as “chew power.” To the Taiwanese, it’s QQ: “chewy-chewy.”</p>
  <p>They come in soup or, even better, “dry,” noodles tangled around thin, tender petals of lamb or plush beef hunks, in a dark semi-slush of house-made chile oil, lamb or beef stock and a secret spice mixture, roasted each morning, with a warming pulse of cumin. The same seasonings go into the shiitake-base soup, slightly less pronounced but still inflamed and life-giving on a winter day.</p>

  <p>Lamb and beef are both heady from a night spent in Chinese five-spice, star anise, garlic, ginger and soy, followed by hours of luxuriating in Shaoxing wine. (There are supposed to be Sichuan peppercorns, too, but I felt no buzz on the lips.) Both have a surprise rival in mock duck, rough flaps of seitan somehow magicked by soy and chile oil, looking like honeycomb tripe and so meaty tasting that for a moment I thought I’d misread the ingredients.</p>

  <p>Then there is Taiwanese beef noodle soup, its lovely fathoms contoured by orange peel, tomatoes, fermented bean curd and doubanjiang (hot broad-bean paste), with mustard greens added at the very end, just to wilt. Offered a choice of mild or spicy, don’t hesitate: On the menu, the dish is given the prefix “la mei,” which means <i>“spicy girl”</i> — one who is not afraid of chiles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Huang, 32, the chef, is the Californian-born son of Taishanese immigrants from Guangdong Province. Mr. Tondreau, 35, a chef who runs a number of food stalls around the city and collaborated with Mr. Huang on the menu at Very Fresh Noodles, was adopted at 4 months old from South Korea by parents of French-Czechoslovak descent, and grew up in Los Angeles. The name of the restaurant is “an ode to Chinatown,” Mr. Tondreau said, and to the occasionally off-kilter English phrasings found on signs there. Or, as Mr. Huang put it, “a shout-out to Chinese-Americans who owned businesses before us, who didn’t always have the strongest grasp of the language.”</p>

    <div class="p4">
      <p>Too bad there’s nowhere to sit. Sadly, putting in stools would be a fire hazard. Smart diners come early and grab one of the two windowsills, although eating is still a precarious business.</p>

      <p>And the Chelsea Market crowds! It’s hard to feel love for your fellow man when the tourists ahead of you in line are quibbling over paying tax, or holding up their bowls to ask, after the fact, if they can have a new set of noodles without herbs. Hell is other customers.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, a couple asked for “just noodles.” The cashier wasn’t sure what they meant. “No spices,” they said. Mr. Huang looked distressed.</p>

  <p>“It’s Chinese food,” he said, as gently as possible. “We want the chile oil.”
    <br><br>
    The cashier smiled at the couple. “No spices,” he said, and took their order.</p>
