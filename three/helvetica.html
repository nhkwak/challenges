  <h1>helvetica</h1>

  <div class="one">
    <span class="regular"> Helvetica was developed in 1957 by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei (Haas Type Foundry) of MÃ¼nchenstein, Switzerland. </span>

    <span class="caption">regular</span>

    <span class="light">Haas set out to design a new sans-serif typeface that could compete with the successful Akzidenz Grotesk in the Swiss market.</span>

    <span class="caption">light</span>


    <span class="bold"> Originally called Neue Haas Grotesk, its design was based on Schelter-Grotesk and Haas' Normal Grotesk. The aim of the new design was to create a neutral typeface that had great clarity, no intrinsic meaning in its form, and could be used on a wide variety of signage.</span>

    <span class="caption">bold</span>


    <span class="italic">When Linotype adopted Neue Haas Grotesk (which was never planned to be a full range of mechanical and hot-metal typefaces) its design was reworked. After the success of Univers, Arthur Ritzel of Stempel redesigned Neue Haas Grotesk into a larger family.</span>
